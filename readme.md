- [**Star Rating**](https://github.com/winterzmm/formassembly-scripts-and-styles/blob/main/star-rating.html) - Script and Style for a star rating custom question type. It converts a radio button question with "{$STAR RATING}" at the start of the question label and a horizontal choice layout into a star rating question. It is recommended that the choices be numbered 5 to 1 in descending order.
